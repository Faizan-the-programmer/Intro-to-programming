###Introduction to programming

Now before we understand what programming is, you must know what is a computer. 

A computer is a device that can accept human instruction, processes it, and responds to it or a computer is a computational device that is used to process the data under the control of a computer program.

Program is a sequence of instruction along with data. 

The basic components of a computer are: 

1. Input unit
2. Central Processing Unit(CPU)
3. Output unit

The CPU is further divided into three parts-  
1. Memory unit
2. Control unit
3. Arithmetic Logic unit

A *CPU* is commonly known as the brain of the computer. It accepts data, stores it on temporary unit until saved on hard disk. It also performs logical operations and processes data into information.

***<span style="color:Green">A program is a set of instructions given to computer to perform a specific task. Computer programs are written in Programming Languages.***

We hace many programming languages c, c++, python, java, kotlin, swift, etc., to name a few.

Programming languages can be then divided into High level and Low level languages.

A computer only understands binary language that is 1's and 0's.

###Introduction to text editor
A text editor is a simple computer program that allows users to create, change, or edit plain text files. It can be used for creating computer programs, editing the source code of programming languages, editing hypertext markup language (HTML), and creating web pages or web design templates. 

Examples of few text editors are: Notepad, Notepad++, VS Code, Sublime text, Nano, Vim, etc.

###Introduction to C++/Cpp
C++ is a general purpose programming language. It can be used to write different types of programs.

It can be used for both command line and Graphical User Interfase (GUI) type of programs.

Cpp is a high perfomence language applications.

It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.

####Why Use C++
* C++ is one the most world's most popular programming languages.
* C++ is used to make Operating Systems', GUI's and embedded systems.
* C++ is an Objected Oriented Programming language that gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
* C++ can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
* C++ is fun and easy to learn!
* As C++ is close to C# and java, it makes it easy to switch between C#, C++ and java.

####Basics
```C++
 // C++ Hello World Program
include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
  cout << "Hello World!\n";
  return 0;
}
```

The following program is a basic C++ program that prints out: ***Hello World!***

Now I am going to break the code and explain the parts of it.

**1. The *//* in the beggining of the code is known as a comment. This part of the code is ignored by the compiler.**
**2. The *#include* on the 2nd line liks to the iostream which is the standard file which is necessary for basic input/output library in C++**
